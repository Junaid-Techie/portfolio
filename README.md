## Overview

I am a Data Engineer with over five years of industry experience building and operating production-grade data platforms, followed by graduate research focused on real-time data systems, analytics, and applied machine learning.

Most of my professional work has been in enterprise environments where source code cannot be publicly shared. This GitHub profile serves as a growing portfolio to document selected projects, experiments, and learning efforts that reflect my experience in data engineering, streaming systems, and applied Generative AI.

## Current Public Project

### PythonCodeGen-Repo
**Focus:** Local-first code generation using small language models

This repository explores building and optimizing a local code generation assistant using fine-tuned language models. The work focuses on practical concerns such as data preprocessing, model efficiency, and inference on limited hardware rather than relying on hosted APIs.

Key areas:
- Fine-tuning small language models on Python code datasets
- Applying 4-bit quantization techniques (QLoRA) for efficient inference
- Exploring reproducible, local inference workflows suitable for enterprise environments

Repository: `PythonCodeGen-Repo`
